# docker-mysql-phpmyadmin

To run the Docker Compose file that you have created, follow these steps:

- Make sure that you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/get-started

- Create a new directory and save the Docker Compose file in it.

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Docker Compose file.

- Run the following command to start the containers:

  `docker-compose up -d`
- This command will start the containers in detached mode, which means that they will run in the background. If you want to see the logs from the         containers, you can run the command without the -d option.

- Wait for the containers to start up. You can check the status of the containers by running the following command:

  `docker-compose ps`
- This command will show you the status of the containers.

- Once the containers are running, you can access phpMyAdmin by opening a web browser and going to http://localhost:8080. You should see the phpMyAdmin login page.

- To stop the containers, run the following command:

  `docker-compose down`
- This command will stop and remove the containers. If you want to remove the containers and the data volumes, you can run the command with the --volumes option:

`docker-compose down --volumes`
